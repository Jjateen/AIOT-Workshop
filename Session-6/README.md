# Session 6: Assignment and Project Submission

Welcome to Session 6 of the AIoT Workshop! This is an assignment session where you'll get to apply all that you've learned and demonstrate your project-building skills. Follow the steps below to complete and submit your assignment successfully.

## Instructions

Click on the Star button at the top-right of this page.
### 1. Fork the Repository and clone it

To get started, **fork this repository**. This will create a copy of the workshop materials in your GitHub account, allowing you to make changes and create your own project.

1. Click on the **Fork** button at the top-right of this page.
2. Select your GitHub account to create the fork.
3. Clone your repo
      ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your_github_ID>/AIOT-Workshop.git
   ```

### 2. Create Your Project for Session 6

Now that you have your own copy of the repository, it's time to work on your project for Session 6. For this session, your task is to design and implement a unique project that demonstrates your understanding of the workshop materials. Your project can include elements such as IoT connectivity, object detection, hand tracking, or other AI/ML-based implementations learned during the sessions.

- **Suggested Areas to Explore:**
  - Sensor-based automation and control using IoT platforms
  - AI-driven features like object detection or tracking
  - Integration with IoT cloud services for real-time monitoring
  - Creative applications using Arduino, ESP32, or other hardware discussed

### 3. Create a Separate Branch

After deciding on your project, create a separate branch based on your team name. This will help keep your project organized and distinct.

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your forked repository.
2. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <your-team-name>
   ```

### 4. Commit and Push Your Project

Once you’re happy with your project, it’s time to add your work to the branch and push it to GitHub.

0. Write good **documentaion** of your project

1. **Commit** all your project files to the new branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Session 6 Project"
   ```
2. **Push** your changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin <your-team-name>
   ```

### 5. Submit a Pull Request (PR)

After pushing your project to your branch, submit a pull request to the main repository for review.

1. Go to the **original repository** (this repository).
2. Click on **Pull Requests** and select **New Pull Request**.
3. Choose **compare across forks** if necessary, then select your forked repository and your branch.
4. Add a clear title and description to your pull request, then click **Create Pull Request**.

### 6. Review and Judging

Your submission will be reviewed by the workshop instructors according to our judging parameters. We’re looking for:

- **Creativity and Originality**: How unique and innovative is your project?
- **Code Quality and Organization**: How well-structured and readable is your code?
- **Functionality**: Does the project work as intended and meet the requirements?
- **Presentation**: Is the project documented effectively for understanding and reproducibility?

The **best project** will be merged into the main branch, and the rest will remain in their respective branches based on team names. The creator of the selected project will receive special recognition, and their project will be credited in the main repository.

Happy Making!
